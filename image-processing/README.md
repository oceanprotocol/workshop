# 🖼️ Image Filters Grid Generator
This project demonstrates how to apply multiple image filters to a single image and visualize them in a neatly arranged grid. The code uses Python's Pillow (PIL) library to apply 20+ filters, save the filtered images, and generate a final combined grid image.

# ✨ Features
### ✅ Downloads an image from a URL
### ✅ Applies 20+ image filters & transformations (blur, sharpen, emboss, invert, etc.)
### ✅ Saves each filtered image individually
### ✅ Creates a grid collage of all filtered images with labeled names
### ✅ Simple, reusable code structure
### ✅ Works even without external fonts (fallback to default)
